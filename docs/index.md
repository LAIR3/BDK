# Overview

[Kurtosis](https://docs.kurtosis.com/) is a developer platform that allows you to package and launch a backend stack without becoming overburdened with configuration details.

Kudos to the Polygon team for implementing a stable modular CDK build including node components, services and validium as a rollup option.

Kurtosis-CDK is the configuration environment for blockchain development. LAIR3-BDK is striving to become the layer3 Blockchain Deployment Kit.

## CDK architecture

The diagram below shows how CDK stack components may interact with each other and with a layer 1 blockchain.

## Get started

The [quick start documents](quickstart/deploy-stack.md) show you how to deploy a private, portable, and modular Polygon-SDK as Kustosis-CDK developer stack on [Kurtosis](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis).<br />

It is apparent that the current blockchain architecture requires layer3 to scale for increased throughput as a payment, gaming and AI layer to continue progressive innovation in the blockchain cryptosphere. LAIR3-BDK has fixed the panopticon integration and extensively documented this project with .md files for markdown language.
